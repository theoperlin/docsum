# Document Summarizer ![](https://github.com/theoperlin/docsum2/workflows/tests/badge.svg)
`docsum.py` summarizes any text document at a first grade reading level using the Groq API. 
It takes any text document (pdf, html, txt, etc.) as a command line argument and returns a simplified summary. 

## Usage
After installing the requirements listed in `requirements.txt`, docsum can be called in the command line like so:

`$ python3 docsum.py <your_document_name>`
